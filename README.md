# Agile Software Development Method
We have look into three types of Agile Development Methods : Scrum, Kanban, Lean. //
With Scrum and Lean, they are both great as a management approach with Scrum being efficient, and Lean being calculative. However, it is difficult for us to implement these two approaches since we don't have a concrete goal for this project yet. Therefore, we will look for a method that is more adaptive and flexible to implement.

So we concluded that, Kanban would be our best choice.

We also noted that the "Scrumban" method, which is a combination of Scrum and Kanban would be a benefitial for our project. We might consider this approach as our project unfolded.

## Tech stack
|Front-end|Pros|Cons|
|---|---|---|
|Dash (Preferred)|•Perfect for Dashboarding and data visualization<br>•Good callback debugger<br>•Highly scalable|•Does not really have any disadvantages as dash is written for data scientists|
|React|•Good for Dynamic web pages <br>•Components are reusable<br>•Ease of testing|•React evolves quickly<br>•Lacks proper documentation<br>•Lacking in features for a framework|
|Vue|•Lightweight with reliable performance<br>•Good documentation<br>•Supports two-way bindings|•Lack of libraries compared to other frameworks<br>•Difficulty in scaling|

|Back-end|Pros|Cons|
|---|---|---|
|Django|•Can be used for both front-end and back-end<br>•Built with scalability in mind<br>•Ready to use and customizable admin features|•It is not ideal for small projects with minimal features<br>•Steep learning curve<br>•Unable to handle multiple requests simultaneously|
|ExpressJS|•Capable of handling multiple requests<br>•Customizable<br>•Quick deployment|•Not ideal for CPU intensive work<br>•Lacks standardization<br>•Lacks support for asynchronous errors|
|Flask|•light-weight framework<br>•Suitable for small projects<br>•Customizable|•Does not have built-in support for basic database system<br>•Slow deployment of minimum viable product<br>•Limited community support|

## Machine Learning algorithms
|Algorithms|Pros|Cons|
|---|---|---|
|Google AutoML|•Easy to use|•Model train time caps at 1 hour for free users|
|VGG16|•Easy to use|•High inference time (time for model to process new data and make predictions)|
|Self-written|•Gain knowledge in machine learning<br>•Specific to what client wants|•Time consuming<br>•Might not be as efficient<br>•Outside of skill set|
