# Agile Software Development Method
We have look into three types of Agile Development Methods : Scrum, Kanban, Lean. //
With Scrum and Lean, they are both great as a management approach with Scrum being efficient, and Lean being calculative. However, it is difficult for us to implement these two approaches since we don't have a concrete goal for this project yet. Therefore, we will look for a method that is more adaptive and flexible to implement.

So we concluded that, Kanban would be our best choice.

We also noted that the "Scrumban" method, which is a combination of Scrum and Kanban would be a benefitial for our project. We might consider this approach as our project unfolded.
